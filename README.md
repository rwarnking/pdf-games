## Installation

If you are only interested in the PDF you can download a `zip` containing all PDFs from
[here](github.com/rwarnking/pdf-games/releases/latest).
To program such a PDF yourself you need this:

1. install LaTeX e.g. [TeX Live](https://www.tug.org/texlive/)
2. install the insdljs package
    * This package is not necessarily component of the default LaTeX packages and needs to be
        installed manually
    * Download the acrotex bundle [Source1](https://ctan.org/pkg/insdljs) | [Source2](http://www.math.uakron.edu/~dpstory/webeq.html)
    * Unzip the bundle
    * Use `tex acrotex.ins` to compile the file and to get the insdljs.sty
    * Check that the files are found by LaTeX e.g. by putting them in the same directory

### Dependencies

#### Mandatory
- [insdljs](https://ctan.org/pkg/insdljs)

#### Mandatory when using template
- [tcolorbox](https://www.ctan.org/pkg/tcolorbox)

## Usage

Simply compile the `.tex` file to PDF and open the PDF with `Adobe Acrobat Reader`,
other PDF viewer were not tested and may not be able to run the JavaScript.

OBACHT: Different compiler might leed to different outputs for example regarding spacing.
The here used compiler was `pdfLaTeX` with TeX live version `2021`.
Furthermore you might need to enable the JavaScript even when using Adobe,
